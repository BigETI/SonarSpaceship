# Sectors

A sector is a set of levels that follow a certain style and a set difficulty range.

## Novum Rimor (translated: A new explorer)

Novum Rimor lies in the outskirts of the galaxy where not so many stars are available. Its purpose is to introduce the game to the player where each game mechanic is shown per level.

### Novum Rimor (I)

A pretty much straight line that introduces the idea of moving your ship from A to B without any real obstacles.

### Novum Rimor (II)

The second level in Novum Rimor teaches a player how to navigate through space with some obstacles in between them.

### Novum Rimor (III)

The third level in Novum Rimor introduces mines, which adds another type of obstacle.

### Novum Rimor (IV)

The fourth level introduces the ability to refill your spaceship.

There are now more and longer corridors to fly through

### Novum Rimor (V)

A collection of game mechanics introduced before to make the player feel comfortable with the introduced game mechanics.

### Novum Rimor (VI)

Last level in this sector that is harder that the fifth level, still easier than the upcoming sectors.

## Anser (translated: Goose)

Anser is known for its star constellation seen from your home star system.
It feels like that this place doesn't want you to come near it.

### Rostro

Rostro is a rocky place, most likely cause by the neighbouring three star systems.

### Collum

Collum is known for its tube like shaped rock formations, where mines are floating around

### Ventri

Ventri feels like an arena of rocks with mines.

### Pedibus

A place with densly packed rocks. If feels hard to navigate through them.

### Cauda

Strangely this place has neatly formed mines floating around, as if someone did expect me coming there.

### Brunneis

This place is just a mess of rocks and mines.

Good luck navigating through it.

## Venandi (translated: Hunter)

The venandi sector belonged to a former colony, which got extinct from a supernova.

### Esca

The first level that contains multiple containers.

Rocks and mines are pretty much spread out in this level.

### Aspicio

This level feels like you are navigating through a labyrinth.

### Venari

The heart of the former colony. There are many rocks and debris floating around.

### Mortem

This place is where the star was located. Now there is just a black hole with rocks floating around.

### Somnium

Is it me, or are those containers moving around?

### Consurge

A densily packed area with moving rocks, mines and containers.

## Mors Lapides (translated: Death stones)

This corner of space isn't well documented. It appears to be a place where an ancient alien civilization did colonize it.

### Mors Lapides (I)

Rocks... Are they trying to hit me?

### Mors Lapides (II)

Now also mines... What is going on here?

### Mors Lapides (III)

Is the container now flying away from me?

## Spatium Anomalias (translated: Space anomalies)

You are pretty much the first one stepping foot in this area. Who knows what awaits you there.

### Parvae Anomaliae

The containers are now teleporting around. That should be impossible according to our previous research.

### Magna Anomaliae

Rocks and mines also move and teleport around. This is really strange.

### Pura Anomaliae

I am being teleported around. Please stop it!
